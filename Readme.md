# Gaming Jeopardy
## Unit 1 Project

### Instructions 
#### One round Jeopardy!

1. Click on a question under a category and a multiple choice question will appear.
2. If you answer it right you get that money added to your score, if you get it wrong that money is subtracted
3. After answering each question, click on the "end game" button to see how you did.


### Coding Architecture 

Made with JavaScript/JQuery

At first I was attempting to do BlackJack for this project, and I got close but I wanted to have a finished product for the deadline so I went with Jeopardy. 

As a result the code has a lot of repeating functions and modals. The functionality is all there but the code could be cleaned up with loops.

For the value of the questions it seemed easier to give that number in the HTML where each question is generated so I could reference it in the JavaScript with ease
